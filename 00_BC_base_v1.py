""" Base Component -- Version 1
Welcome screen and message created here
Pre-combos added to a dictionary inside a dictionary here
Adding each component as they are created
Not much editing done to the code
Adding code to add function so user cannot
make a new combo with the same name.
When input code entered, changing it to use
the char_boundary function.
Added components 1, 2, and 3.
